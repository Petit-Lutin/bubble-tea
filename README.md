# Order your bubble tea ðŸ¥¤

## A project with Vue.js and svg

![img](/public/bubbletea_final.svg) 

Have you ever drank bubble teas? If yes, you know they can be customized. If no,  it's a cold beverage where you can customize almost anything.

I wanted to make a small project with Vue.JS, and be able to change the image depending on the selected flavour. I created the svg myself by the way, using Inskcape over a sketch I made.

Inspirations for this project are : Adibu, Candy Crush.
